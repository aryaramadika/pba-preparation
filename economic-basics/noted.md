## 🧠 Incentives

> “An incentive is a bullet, a key: an often tiny object with astonishing power to change a situation.”  
> — _Steven Levitt_

Incentives are powerful motivators that can alter behavior in meaningful ways — even small incentives can produce significant effects.

**Examples:**

- 💼 A bonus in a company increases productivity.
- 🎁 Rewards in education improve student performance.
- 🛍️ Discounts in business attract more customers.

> **Note:** Not all incentives are monetary!

## 🧠 Rationality in Economics

Economics assumes that individuals are:

- Focused on **payoff maximization**
- Acting in **self-interest**
- Equipped with **unlimited cognitive resources**

---

## ⚖️ Incentives in Action

- **Interest Rates (by Central Banks):**
  - ⬇️ _Lower rates:_ encourage borrowing and investment.
  - ⬆️ _Higher rates:_ slow down inflation and stabilize the economy.

### 🐍 Incentives Gone Wrong: The Cobra Effect

- In colonial India, people were paid for every dead cobra.
- People started breeding cobras for reward.
- Once payment was stopped, they released the cobras — making the problem worse.

### 📏 Goodhart’s Law

> “When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure.”

Example:  
In education, if the goal is a high grade, students may cheat — compromising learning and integrity.

> **Note:** Extrinsic motivation can crowd out intrinsic motivation.

## 🧩 Game Theory Basics

Game theory analyzes strategic interactions where outcomes depend on the actions of others.

### 🎯 Key Concepts:

- **Cournot Equilibrium:** Maximize profits by adjusting production based on competitors.
- **Nash Equilibrium:** No player benefits from changing their strategy if others remain the same.

### ⏳ Game Types:

- **Simultaneous (Static):** Players decide at the same time, unaware of others' choices.
- **Sequential (Dynamic):** Players move one after another, observing previous moves.

### 🔐 Information Variants:

- **Complete vs Incomplete Information:** Does everyone know all other players' payoffs?
- **Perfect vs Imperfect Information:** Does everyone observe all previous moves?

### 🔄 Game Structures:

- **Symmetric:** Strategy determines outcome.
- **Asymmetric:** Identity and strategy both affect the outcome.

### ⚔️ Outcome Types:

- **Zero-Sum:** One’s gain is another’s loss.
- **Non-Zero-Sum:** Players can all win or lose.

### 🤝 Collaboration:

- **Cooperative:** Players can form binding agreements.
- **Non-Cooperative:** Players act independently.

## 📐 Utility in Game Theory

Utility measures the satisfaction or benefit from an outcome.

### Examples:

- Prisoner’s Dilemma
- Nash Equilibrium
- Schelling Point
- Ultimatum Game
- Coordination Game

## 💵 Price Finding Mechanisms

- **Posted Price Mechanism**
- **Supply & Demand** (best for large markets with many participants and clear information)

---

## 🏷️ Auction Types

Auctions preserve price discovery.

Types of Auctions:

- **English Auction**
- **Dutch Auction**
- **First-Price Auction**
- **Second-Price Auction (Vickrey)**

> **Revenue Equivalence Theorem:** Different auction formats yield the same expected revenue under certain conditions.
