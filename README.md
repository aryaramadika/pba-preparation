# 📘 Polkadot Blockchain Academy Preparation

This repository documents my personal learning journey and preparation for **Polkadot Blockchain Academy (PBA)**. It includes notes, key concepts, and study materials categorized into various domains such as cryptography, economics, and behavioral assessments.



## 🧠 Study Focus Areas



## 🧠 Learning Focus

### 🔐 Cryptography Intro
- Symmetric vs Asymmetric encryption
- Public/Private key schemes
- Digital signatures (ECDSA, Schnorr)
- Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKP)
- Cryptographic tools used in blockchain security

### 📊 Economic Basics
- Incentive structures: intrinsic vs extrinsic
- Game theory: Nash equilibrium, Cournot model, coordination games
- Supply & demand fundamentals
- Auction theory (English, Dutch, First/Second-price)
- Blockchain-specific: state bloat, lockdrops, token design

### 🧪 PAPI (Polkadot API) Intro
- Using **Polkadot.js API** to interact with Substrate-based chains
- Sending transactions, reading state, subscribing to on-chain data
- Tutorials based on PBA resource modules
- Understanding extrinsics, storage access, events, and RPC


### 🦀 Rust State Machine

#### 📘 Introduction to the Rust State Machine
- Overview of Substrate’s core logic and runtime design
- Understanding state transition logic and deterministic execution

#### 💰 The Balances Pallet
- Basics of the `pallet-balances`
- Managing token balances and transferring funds
- Integrating balances into the runtime

#### 🛠️ The System and Runtime
- **Introduce the System Pallet**: Learn the core system pallet that powers block lifecycle and accounts
- **Making Your System Functional**: Hook system configurations and types into the runtime
- **Creating Our Runtime**: Combine pallets into a functional blockchain runtime
- **Using Our Runtime**: Simulate runtime usage with test scenarios or dev chains
- **Derive Debug**: Add `#[derive(Debug)]` to improve error tracking and log visibility

#### ⚙️ Generic and Configurable Types
- Understand how Substrate uses generics and traits for modular and reusable pallets

#### 🔁 Executing Blocks and Dispatching Calls
- Lifecycle of a block and transaction execution
- How calls (extrinsics) are dispatched and validated in runtime


## 🎯 Goals

- Strengthen fundamentals in blockchain cryptography and economics
- Understand real-world decentralized system incentives
- Become proficient with Polkadot.js API for on-chain interaction
- Prepare effectively for technical assessments during PBA
- Maintain consistent progress and knowledge retention



## 🗓️ Status
